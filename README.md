# Mechlabs Knowledge Base Backend

This is the backend service for the Mechlabs platform's knowledge base, serving Greek Civil Engineers and architects with essential information and resources.

## Technology Stack

- **Strapi**: Headless CMS for content management
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **SQLite**: Default database (can be changed to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production)

## Features

- Content management system for engineering and architectural resources
- Integration with 3rd party authentication service
- RESTful API endpoints for content delivery
- Role-based access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x or v20.x
- npm v6.x or higher

### Version Management

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions:

```bash
# First install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Restart terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for zsh users

# Verify nvm installation first
command -v nvm >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "Loading nvm..."
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
}

# Then install and use Node.js 18.x
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Verify versions
node -v  # Should show v18.x.x
npm -v   # Should show 6.x.x-9.x.x
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd knowledge-base
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# Install Strapi CLI globally (required for build command)
npm install -g @strapi/strapi
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run develop
```

The admin panel will be available at: http://localhost:1337/admin

### Environment Variables

```env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=[your-app-keys]
API_TOKEN_SALT=[your-token-salt]
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=[your-admin-jwt-secret]
JWT_SECRET=[your-jwt-secret]
```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at:
http://localhost:1337/documentation
